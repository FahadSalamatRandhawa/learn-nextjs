### Mapping

mapping creates a key pair relation ship, similar to an object. Or similar to a relationship between array indexed and values. Once the key and pair types have been defined, all (key,value) pairs must be of same type.

- `mapping(string=>int) public nameToAge` this will create a map, by the name of `nameToAge` which has a key of type string and value of type int
