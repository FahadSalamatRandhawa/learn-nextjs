# Hardhat Tutorial

In this directory we will create baby steps to learn Hardhat following this [Tutorial for Beginners](https://hardhat.org/tutorial)

## Understanding hardhat
Hardhat is NOT a programing language but rather a development enviornment for Ethereum contracts(also knows an solidity contracts), consider it like Node.js, the same way Node.js allows us to run JavaScript outside of a browser, Hardhat allows us to run smart contracts locally.

Solidity is used to write smart contracts, hardhat is used to run those contracts but hardhat cannot interact with contracts directly, for that purpose we use Ethers.js. Ethers.js allows us to interact with smart contracts and hardhat allows us to compile them.

It might make more sense to think of solidity contracts as classes, and we use Ethers.js to interact with those classes and make instances, and then test the functionality of those instances while running them in HardHat enviornment. 

### Below I will list some common commands and what they do
